The "0x0F-load_balancer" directory contains Bash scripts for the "0x0F. Load balancer" project. Authored by Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School, the scripts automate the setup of two servers (gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX and gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX). The tasks involve configuring Nginx to add a custom response header and installing HAproxy on the load balancer server (lb-01). The project focuses on redundancy for web servers using load balancing, emphasizing script execution, Shellcheck validation, and proper server hostname configuration.
