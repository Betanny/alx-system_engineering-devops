The primary tasks of this project involve interacting with a REST API to retrieve and display an employee's TODO list progress. The project extends its functionality by exporting this data into CSV and JSON formats. The README provides detailed guidelines for code structure, execution, and documentation, emphasizing adherence to Pythonic coding standards. Specific requirements include the use of the urllib or requests module, proper organization of imported libraries, and the creation of executable files following specific guidelines. The tasks aim to reinforce understanding of APIs, REST APIs, and data formats like CSV and JSON, encouraging clean and well-documented code practices.
