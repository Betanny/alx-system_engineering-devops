The Bash script "0-nginx_likes_port_80" in the ALX System Engineering Web Stack Debugging #1 project addresses an issue where an Ubuntu container's Nginx installation fails to listen on port 80. The script, written by Sylvain Kalache, utilizes debugging skills to identify and resolve the problem. It ensures that Nginx is running and correctly listening on port 80 for all active IPv4 IPs. The script achieves this by configuring the server to meet the specified requirements, with the result demonstrated through a provided example that shows a successful connection to the Nginx web server.
